# Scraplands
---

Scraplands is a post-apocalyptic vehicle racing and combat game. Each player assembles a team of cars, customised with upgrades, weapons, and armour, and competes to out-race and out-fight their opponents in a brutal showdown. Scraplands uses the [Cadence core rules](../core-rules/introduction.md) with some additional rules provided in the following sections.

The models in Scraplands represent heavily modified cars with makeshift weapons and armour. Models around the 1:64 scale similar, to die cast model cars, are the best scale for this game. These models are referred to throughout this module as **cars**, all cars count as having the **vehicle** special rule.
