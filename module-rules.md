# Scraplands Showdown Rules

---

## Playing Scraplands Showdown

Scraplands Showdown is best played on a 3ft x 3ft or larger sized area, though larger battlefields may allow for more interesting tracks to be made.

## Racing

Some missions in Scraplands Showdown follow a race format, having a different activation order to a non race mission. The terrain should be set up to form a looping track with a clear start and finish line. Players agree which direction the track flows and race to complete a set number of laps. In race missions, cars activate in a specific order as determined below:

- The car with the most Command Points remaining activates.
- Cars with the same number of Command Points activate in order of race position. This is the car that is furthest ahead on the track and furthest ahead in laps (i.e. the shortest distance to travel to complete the race).
- The car on the inside of a corner will activate before a car on the outside in a tie.

A race mission ends at the end of any round after which a car has crossed the finish line on their final lap. The final positions of the cars are ranked from the car furthest past the finish line to the car furthest behind.

## Car Movement



### Action: Move

Each time one of your cars performs a Move action it may add d6 inches to its Movement attribute if it makes no pivots. A car's Movement is reduced to 2 inches when moving backward.

If at any point during your move you move into base contact with another car your movement ends and both cars must make a control check as explained below. If you take a Move action whilst in contact with another car, you must pivot so that you can move away from the vehicle, however this does not trigger a control check.

### Action: Advance

When you perform an Advance action you do not move your normal Move attribute in inches, instead you roll 3d6 and take the two highest rolls as your Movement attribute. If you roll any 1s, then you must make a control check as explained below.

### Coasting

When activating a car with 1 Command Point, if you fail the test to use the Command Point you may make a Move Action but only moving up to 3 inches directly forward instead of losing the Command Point.

## Control Checks

At times you may be at risk of losing control of your car; when being attacked, pushing your speed, or colliding with the terrain. When asked to perform a control check roll a d6, on a roll of a 1 you have failed the control check.

- You count as having taken a hit from a Damage 4 weapon, roll to counter this hit as normal.
- If a control check causes your car to lose any hit points your activation immediately ends.

## Terrain

Terrain in Scraplands comes in the following types: Solid, Dangerous, Rough, Destructible, and Ramps.

- **Solid Terrain**: Your car may not move over any terrain with the **solid** keyword. If any move you make brings you into contact with solid terrain your activation immediately ends and you make a control check.
- **Dangerous**: If your car moves over **dangerous** terrain you roll 1 control check for each move or advance action that includes moving through the terrain. If the shape of the terrain does not allow you to place your car part way through the terrain, you may only move through the terrain if you have sufficient movement to completely move past it, otherwise it is treated as Solid terrain.
- **Destructible**: Any terrain with the **destructible** keyword works like any other car, though it does not activate and cannot move. It has a Defence of 4+, Toughness of 3, and 1 Hit Point. If reduced to 0 Hit Points it is removed from the table. Destructible terrain is also usually Solid or Dangerous.
- **Ramps**: Ramps are a special type of terrain that allows your cars to make large jumps. Ramps should have a marked area where cars can move onto the ramp, and moving into any other part of a ramp is treated as moving into solid terrain. When a car moves into contact with the ramp, the action it is doing immediately ends. The car then moves 12 inches directly forward, ignoring any intervening terrain or cars until the end of the movement, it then takes 1 Control Check. If the car cannot be placed due to solid terrain it is removed from the game as it is wrecked.

## Mines

You may place mine tokens around the track, or these may be placed by cars with a mine dropper. These should be no larger than 25mm circles. If any car moves within 1 inch of the marker the mine explodes and is removed from the battlefield. Any car within 3 inches of the token when it explodes takes a Control Check.

## Special Rules

The following special rules apply in games of Scraplands Showdown.

| Special Rules | Effect |
| :------------ | :----- |
| Fast | You add all 3d6 to your Movement when making an Advance action, but each roll of 1 triggers a control check. |

| Sturdy | You may re-roll the d6 to determine the number of hits in a control check. |
| Ramshackle | This may re-roll Counter rolls of 1. |
